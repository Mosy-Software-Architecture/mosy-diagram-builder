# MOSY diagram builder

This web application allows users to create system model specs using the MOSY framework. These diagrams can be exported as code and also imported, in a similar fashion to mermaid syntax. Users can save their diagrams in the application and they'll be available later.

Diagrams use blocks and connecting arrows, split in different swimlanes.
